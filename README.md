🌐 Easybank – Responsive Landing Page Project

Easybank is a fully responsive, scroll-based landing page created as part of my web development learning journey. Originally built in February 2025 as a simple static site, I redesigned it in June 2025 to reflect modern frontend practices and mobile-first design principles.

The goal of the project was to replicate a clean and structured layout based on a real-world design challenge from Frontend Mentor, with attention to responsive grids, typography, and section-based content flow.

📖 Project Overview

The original version was a basic static webpage using plain HTML and CSS. After several months of building my skills, I revisited the project to improve its layout structure, visual hierarchy, and responsiveness across screen sizes.
